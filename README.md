# ü§ñ Indeed Automation Project (Job Scraping & Auto Apply)

This is a Java + Selenium-based automation project that performs the following actions on job platforms like Naukri/Indeed:

- Logs in with a pre-configured Chrome profile
- Searches for custom job keywords and locations
- Scrapes job cards using Selenium WebDriver
- Automatically navigates to job pages
- Applies to jobs if the "Apply" button is available
- Supports multi-page scraping with pagination
- Handles browser windows and popups dynamically

- `Scrappingauto.java`: Logic class for scraping and applying
  - Iterates over job cards on each page
  - Switches to each job window and attempts auto-apply
  - Handles pagination across multiple result pages
  - Uses JavaScriptExecutor and dynamic waits for real-time interactions
